## ðŸ¤” What is GARAGINATOR?

GARAGINATOR connects directly with 2 wires to many popular garage door openers
as a virtual "button" to signal to the opener that it should open (or close).

It can pair with your smart home via Apple Home, and best of all, there is no
internet dependency. All network traffic is _local only_.

Check the [compatibility page](/garaginator/compatibility) to see if GARAGINATOR
will work for you.
