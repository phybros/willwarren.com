This page will allow you to flash different versions of the GARAGINATOR firmware
onto your GARAGINATOR device.

## Instructions

1. Open this page in Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge
   1. Chrome-derived browsers will work too, such as Arc or Brave
1. Plug the GARAGINATOR into a computer via the USB-C port
1. Click the "INSTALL vX.X" button below for the version you want to install
1. Choose `USB JTAG/serial debug unit (...)` from the list of Serial devices
1. Follow the on screen prompts.
1. **WARNING:** If given the choice to `Erase` the whole device, this is effectively a factory reset and you will need to set GARAGINATOR up and pair again from scratch (most people will want to leave this Unchecked).
