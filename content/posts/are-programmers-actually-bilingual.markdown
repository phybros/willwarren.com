>[There is] Evidence suggesting that young computer programmers have "bilingual brains"

<!--more-->
A recent post on [thecodingbrain.wordpress.com](http://thecodingbrain.wordpress.com) suggested that programmers might actually exhibit the same brain functions as someone who is fluent in a second spoken language. Given that programming languages have a lot of the same concepts as spoken languages (grammar, syntax, definitions etc.) it stands to reason that a programmers brain would eventually adapt itself to be able to think in different ways based on the circumstances. Fascinating.
