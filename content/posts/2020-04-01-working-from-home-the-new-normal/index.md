With the recent surge of companies "going remote" due to the COVID-19 outbreak
I thought it might be nice to share some of the things I've learned about remote
work over the years as well as my current setup. I'm doing this in the hope
that maybe it can help someone be more productive in these uncertain times.

I've been fortunate enough to be able to work from home since 2016 when I joined
Trello as a Site Reliability Engineer. Making the transition to remote work was
initially a challenge and a totally new way of thinking, but Trello was very
supportive and set me up with the skills, knowledge, and tools to succeed.

What follows are some of my recommendations for the most important things you
need to succeed at remote work (most important first). If remote work truly is
the "new normal" then there are some tools and practices you can employ in order
to be fully effective at home.

**Gigantic caveat:** I work for a company that is 100% equipped and prepared to
support most job functions remotely, so I am explaining these tips from a
privileged position. I will try to give tips that anyone can use!

## Dedicated Workspace

This is the number one thing that makes the distinction between "Working From
Home" and true "Remote Work". If you don't have a place that is annointed as the
Place Of Work in your home, it's all too easy to blur the lines between home
life and work life (more about that later).

Working from your kitchen island, dining table, or other shared space should
generally be a no-go, unless you can close the door on the room that space
occupies the table and guarantee that dinner or any other activities won't
displace your new workspace (and conversely, that your work doesn't displace 
dinner!).

Generally as long as you have a desk, somewhere to use your computer and write
in notebooks or review documents is all you need. If, at the end of the work
day, you can just walk away and leave everything set up as-is, then you've
got this piece of the Remote Work puzzle figured out.

One more tip: **do not** work from your bed.

### Good Tools

In addition to _where_ you work, _how_ you work is probably equally important.
If you're using an ancient computer or you're trying to view a massive
spreadsheet on a tiny screen, your productivity will crater.

If possible try and get a hold of a decent external monitor, and a halfway
decent computer (or lobby your employer for the same). There's nothing that
kills motivation quite like waiting for minutes for files to open.

    title="The docking station is crucial"

In the above photo, there's a 27" LG monitor, and a CalDigit TS3+ dock so I can
live the single-cable life. The keyboard is an Apple Magic Keyboard 2 and the 
mouse is a Logitech MX Master 3. I also have a cheap webcam on top of the screen
because I like to use my laptop in clamshell mode.

## A Door That Closes

Being able to physically partition your work place from your life has many
benefits for work/life balance as well as general mental wellness. In addition
not only can a door separate you from your workspace, but can also isolate you
from a busy home if you have small kids or a significant other also working
remotely.

Another thing that some of my remote colleagues and I make use of is using the
door as a message board. Some will have full whiteboards with an outline of 
their schedule on the door, but I choose something simpler — if the door is
closed, I'm probably in a meeting.

{{< figure

    link="cover.jpg"
    alt="Photo of a post-it on my door that says IN MEETINGS"
    title="A door that closes is worth its weight in toilet paper"
>}}

Again, I'm super fortunate that I'm able to dedicate a room in my home to my
work setup. If you can, do. If you can't, there are solutions some my
colleagues employ to great effect when your desk is in your bedroom or living
room. Some use photography backdrops or inexpensive folding room dividers 
behind them to both physically partition off the room, and also to clean up
their background on video calls.

## Meet With Your Team Often (Over Video)

There's no better way to feel isolated and alone than to never speak to anyone.
Or, never speak to anyone about anything other than work. Frequent video calling
is crucial to maintaining any sort of trust or relationships with the people you
work with day in and day out.

The Video piece is especially important. The added dimension of hand gestures
facial expression adds a wealth of context and intent to a conversation. Not to
mention Zoom has a pretty hilarious Virtual Background feature which can be used
and abused to devastating effect (in a good way).

## Assume Remote


This tip is a general remote working rule not specific to the COVID-19 days,
but it is one of the simplest, most effective tips for levelling the playing
field at work.


Eliminate "floating head syndrome". If one person on a video call is remote,
everyone should be joining the call individually from their own computers.
There's nothing worse than being on a call remotely, while everyone else is
in a conference room and your 6ft wide head is floating on a giant screen.

Everyone should just join from their own computers.

## Ergonomics

If you're not comfortable while working you will end up resenting having to sit
there all day, as well as putting yourself at risk for repetetive strain
injuries or unnecessary muscle tension and strains.

Bottom line: if you're uncomfortable at work, you're going to be a lot less
productive.
