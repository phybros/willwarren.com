When working on a program that has a GUI, it's very important to make sure that the UI is fast and responsive. If your program is performing a lot of long-running actions (writing to a database, making network calls etc.) you should always make sure that the code that is performing those actions is not being executed by the same thread that the GUI is on.<!--more-->

The answer is of course asynchronous programming. Asynchronous code is executed on a different thread than your main one so that your main thread is free to do other things like draw pretty buttons and whatnot.

.NET makes it super easy to run code on a different thread - especially if you don't care about the result. The function below just blocks whatever thread it's on for a specified number of milliseconds.

```vbnet
Private Sub DoSomething(ByVal LengthInMilliseconds As Integer)
    Thread.Sleep(LengthInMilliseconds)
    Console.WriteLine("***** Work Complete *****")
End Sub
```

Now if you call this function on your main (UI) thread in a button click handler or something, the thread will block until the operation is complete. You need to call it on a different thread. Let's create a new version of this function that will be asynchronous:

```vbnet
Private Sub DoSomethingAsync(ByVal LengthInMilliseconds As Integer)
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(AddressOf DoSomething, LengthInMilliseconds)
End Sub
```

Now you can call `DoSomethingAsync` from your main thread and it will be delegated out to a worker thread by the ThreadPool class.Â The `ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem` call is an extremely useful one-liner for asynchronous operations when you don't care about the result.

I created a really simple Windows Forms project to demonstrate the code you see here.
