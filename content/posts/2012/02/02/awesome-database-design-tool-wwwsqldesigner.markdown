I stumbled across this software while trawling the internet looking for good design tools. It's super simple to use and looks great. Because it's web based (written almost entirely in Javascript), you can design without having to have any gigantic software packages installed. Also it's free and open-source which I'm always a fan of!

If you want to use it, it helps to have a web server to install it on, but it's not mandatory. If you have a web server with a database server, you get the added bonus of being able to save your designs to the database using PHP and MySQL. If you don't have a database server and/or web server, you can save the design as an xml file, and load it again super easily.

It's hosted over at Google Code:Â [http://code.google.com/p/wwwsqldesigner/](http://code.google.com/p/wwwsqldesigner/)
